# 👋 Hi, I’m aaa I’m just a regular guy trying to figure out automated testing and keeping my code here to help me find a job – and maybe help you too, if you want to check it out and see things from a different perspective… peace! 

## About Me  
- 💻 **Test Automation Enthusiast:**  
  I'm currently transitioning from a senior manual tester role to an automation tester. I focus on creating browser-based system automation using **Java (Selenium/TestNG)** and **Python (Pytest)**.  

- 🎶 **Music Producer:**  
  I create experimental electro music inspired by Detroit electro legends like Drexciya and Dopplereffekt. I use hardware synths like Arturia MicroFreak, Roland TB-303, and Elektron Digitakt, aiming to merge analog and digital worlds into futuristic dance tracks.  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- Test automation frameworks (Selenium, TestNG, Pytest)  
- Framework design patterns (Page Object Model, Data-Driven Testing)  
- Advanced Python & Java for test automation  

## 👀 I’m interested in:  
- Test Automation (Web/UI/API)  
- Electro music production and sound design  
- Tech, music gear, and creative coding  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
- Open-source test automation projects  
- Music collaborations with like-minded electro producers  

## 📫 How to reach me:  
- [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/GalaxySurfer303)  
- **Music Projects & Inquiries:** Drop me a message here!  

## 😄 Pronouns:  
- He/Him  

## ⚡ Fun fact:  
I combine technology and art: testing systems by day, producing dark, futuristic electro tracks by night. Always chasing the perfect sound and the cleanest code!
